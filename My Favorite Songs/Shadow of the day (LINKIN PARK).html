			     <p>I close both locks below the window<br>
					I close both blinds and turn away<br>
					Sometimes solutions aren't so simple<br>
					Sometimes goodbye's the only way, oh<br><br><br>
					And the sun will set for you<br>
					The sun will set for you<br>
					And the shadow of the day<br>
					Will embrace the world in gray<br>
					And the sun will set for you<br><br><br>
					In cards and flowers on your <br>
					Your friends all plead for you to stay<br>
					Sometimes beginnings aren't so simple<br>
					Sometimes goodbye's the only way, oh<br><br><br>
					And the sun will set for you<br>
					The sun will set for you<br>
					And the shadow of the day<br>
					Will embrace the world in gray<br>
					And the sun will set for you<br><br><br>
					And the shadow of the day<br>
					Will embrace the world in gray<br>
					And the sun will set for you<br><br><br>
					And the shadow of the day<br>
					Will embrace the world in gray<br>
					And the sun will set for you</p>
