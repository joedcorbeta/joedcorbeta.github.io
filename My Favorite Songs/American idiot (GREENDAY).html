			     <p>Don't wanna be an American idiot<br>
					Don't want a nation under the new media<br>
					And can you hear the sound of hysteria?<br>
					The subliminal mind-fuck America<br><br><br>
					Welcome to a new kind of tension<br>
					All across the alien nation<br>
					Where everything isn't meant to be okay<br>
					Television dreams of tomorrow<br>
					We're not the ones who're meant to follow<br>
					For that's enough to argue<br><br><br>
					Well maybe I'm the faggot America<br>
					I'm not a part of a redneck agenda<br>
					Now everybody do the propaganda<br>
					And sing along to the age of paranoia<br><br><br>
					Welcome to a new kind of tension<br>
					All across the alien nation<br>
					Where everything isn't meant to be okay<br>
					Television dreams of tomorrow<br>
					We're not the ones who're meant to follow<br>
					For that's enough to argue<br><br><br>
					Don't wanna be an American idiot<br>
					One nation controlled by the media<br>
					Information Age of hysteria<br>
					It's calling out to idiot America<br><br><br>
					Welcome to a new kind of tension<br>
					All across the alien nation<br>
					Where everything isn't meant to be okay<br>
					Television dreams of tomorrow<br>
					We're not the ones who're meant to follow<br>
					For that's enough to argue</p>
