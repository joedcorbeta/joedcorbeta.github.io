			     <p>Summer has come and passed<br>
					The innocent can never last<br>
					Wake me up when September ends<br><br>
					Like my fathers come to pass<br>
					Seven years has gone so fast<br>
					Wake me up when September ends<br><br>
					Here comes the rain again<br>
					Falling from the stars<br>
					Drenched in my pain again<br>
					Becoming who we are<br><br>
					As my memory rests<br>
					But never forgets what I lost<br>
					Wake me up when September ends<br><br>
					Summer has come and passed<br>
					The innocent can never last<br>
					Wake me up when September ends<br><br>
					Ring out the bells again<br>
					Like we did when spring began<br>
					Wake me up when September ends<br><br>
					Here comes the rain again<br>
					Falling from the stars<br>
					Drenched in my pain again<br>
					Becoming who we are<br><br>
					As my memory rests<br>
					But never forgets what I lost<br>
					Wake me up when September ends<br><br>
					Summer has come and passed<br>
					The innocent can never last<br>
					Wake me up when September ends<br><br>
					Like my father's come to pass<br>
					Twenty years has gone so fast<br>
					Wake me up when September ends<br>
					Wake me up when September ends<br>
					Wake me up when September ends</p>
