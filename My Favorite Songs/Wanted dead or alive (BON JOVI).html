			     <p>It's all the same, only the names will change<br>
					Everyday, it seems we're wastin' away<br>
					Another place where the faces are so cold<br>
					I drive all night just to get back home<br><br>
					I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride<br>
					I'm wanted dead or alive<br><br>
					Wanted dead or alive<br>
					Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days<br>
					The people I meet always go their separate ways<br>
					Sometimes you tell the day<br>
					By the bottle that you drink<br>
					And times when you're all alone all you do is think<br><br>
					I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride<br>
					I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive<br>
					Wanted (wanted) dead or alive<br><br>
					Oh, and I ride<br><br>
					Oh, and I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride<br>
					I'm wanted dead or alive<br><br>
					I walk these streets<br>
					A loaded six-string on my back<br>
					I play for keeps 'cause I might not make it back<br>
					I been everywhere, still, I'm standing tall<br>
					I've seen a million faces<br>
					And I've rocked them all<br><br>
					I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride<br>
					I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive<br>
					I'm a cowboy, I got the night on my side<br>
					I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive<br>
					And I ride, dead or alive<br>
					I still drive (I still drive) dead or alive<br>
					Dead or alive, dead or alive, dead or alive, dead or alive</p>
