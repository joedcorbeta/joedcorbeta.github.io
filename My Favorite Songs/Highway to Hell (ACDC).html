			     <p>Living easy, living free<br>
					Season ticket on a one-way ride<br>
					Asking nothing, leave me be<br>
					Taking everything in my stride<br>
					Don't need reason, don't need rhyme<br>
					Ain't nothing I would rather do<br>
					Going down, party time<br>
					My friends are gonna be there too<br><br>
					I'm on the highway to hell<br>
					On the highway to hell<br>
					Highway to hell<br>
					I'm on the highway to hell<br><br>
					No stop signs, speed limit<br>
					Nobody's gonna slow me down<br>
					Like a wheel, gonna spin it<br>
					Nobody's gonna mess me around<br>
					Hey Satan, paid my dues<br>
					Playing in a rocking band<br>
					Hey mama, look at me<br>
					I'm on my way to the promised land, whoo!<br><br>
					I'm on the highway to hell<br>
					Highway to hell<br>
					I'm on the highway to hell<br>
					Highway to hell<br><br>
					Don't stop me<br><br>
					I'm on the highway to hell<br>
					On the highway to hell<br>
					I'm on the highway to hell<br>
					On the highway<br>
					Yeah, highway to hell<br>
					I'm on the highway to hell<br>
					Highway to hell<br>
					Highway to hell<br><br>
					And I'm going down<br>
					All the way<br>
					Whoa!<br>
					I'm on the highway to hell</p>
