			     <p>Do you have the time to listen to me whine<br>
					About nothing and everything all at once<br>
					I am one of those<br>
					Melodramatic fools<br>
					Neurotic to the bone<br>
					No doubt about it<br><br><br>
					Sometimes I give myself the creeps<br>
					Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me<br>
					It all keeps adding up<br>
					I think I'm cracking up<br>
					Am I just paranoid?<br>
					Or am I just stoned<br><br><br>
					I went to a shrink<br>
					To analyze my dreams<br>
					She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down<br>
					I went to a whore<br>
					He said my life's a bore<br>
					So quit my whining cause it's bringing her down<br><br><br>
					Sometimes I give myself the creeps<br>
					Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me<br>
					It all keeps adding up<br>
					I think I'm cracking up<br>
					Am I just paranoid?<br>
					A ya-ya-ya<br><br><br>
					Grasping to control<br>
					So I better hold on<br><br><br>
					Sometimes I give myself the creeps<br>
					Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me<br>
					It all keeps adding up<br>
					I think I'm cracking up<br>
					Am I just paranoid?<br>
					Or am I just stoned?</p>
