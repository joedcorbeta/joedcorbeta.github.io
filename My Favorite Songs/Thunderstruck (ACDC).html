			     <p>Thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder<br>
					I was caught<br>
					In the middle of a railroad track<br>
					I looked round<br>
					And I knew there was no turning back<br><
					My mind raced<br>
					And I thought what could I do<br>
					And I knew<br>
					There was no help, no help from you<br>
					Sound of the drums<br>
					Beating in my heart<br>
					The thunder of guns<br>
					Tore me apart<br>
					You've been<br>
					Thunderstruck<br><br>
					Rode down the highway<br>
					Broke the limit, we hit the town<br>
					Went through to Texas, yeah Texas, and we had some fun<br>
					We met some girls<br>
					Some dancers who gave a good time<br>
					Broke all the rules<br>
					Played all the fools<br>
					Yeah yeah they, they, they blew our minds<br>
					And I was shaking at the knees<br>
					Could I come again please<br>
					Yeah them ladies were too kind<br>
					You've been<br>
					Thunderstruck<br><br>
					I was shaking at the knees<br>
					Could I come again please<br><br>
					Thunderstruck, Thunderstruck, Thunderstruck, Thunderstruck<br>
					It's alright, we're doin' fine<br>
					It's alright, we're doin' fine, fine, fine<br>
					Thunderstruck, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
					Thunderstruck, Thunderstruck<br>
					Thunderstruck, baby, baby<br>
					Thunderstruck, you've been Thunderstruck<br>
					Thunderstruck, Thunderstruck<br>
					You've been Thunderstruck</p>
