			     <p>I dreamed I was missing<br>
					You were so scared<br>
					But no one would listen<br>
					Cause no one else cared<br>
					After my dreaming<br>
					I woke with this fear<br>
					What am I leaving<br>
					When I'm done here?<br>
					So, if you're asking me, I want you to know<br><br>
					When my time comes<br>
					Forget the wrong that I've done<br>
					Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed<br>
					And don't resent me<br>
					And when you're feeling empty<br>
					Keep me in your memory<br>
					Leave out all the rest<br>
					Leave out all the rest<br><br>
					Don't be afraid<br>
					I've taken my beating<br>
					I've shared what I've made<br>
					I'm strong on the surface<br>
					Not all the way through<br>
					I've never been perfect<br>
					But neither have you<br>
					So, if you're asking me, I want you to know<br><br>
					When my time comes<br>
					Forget the wrong that I've done<br>
					Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed<br>
					And don't resent me<br>
					And when you're feeling empty<br>
					Keep me in your memory<br>
					Leave out all the rest<br>
					Leave out all the rest<br><br>
					Forgetting<br>
					All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well<br>
					Pretending<br>
					Someone else can come and save me from myself<br>
					I can't be who you are<br><br>
					When my time comes<br>
					Forget the wrong that I've done<br>
					Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed<br>
					And don't resent me<br>
					And when you're feeling empty<br>
					Keep me in your memory<br>
					Leave out all the rest<br>
					Leave out all the rest<br><br>
					Forgetting<br>
					All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well<br>
					Pretending<br>
					Someone else can come and save me from myself<br>
					I can't be who you are<br>
					I can't be who you are</p>
