			     <p>I remember black skies<br>
					The lightning all around me<br>
					I remember each flash<br>
					As time began to blur<br>
					Like a startling sign<br>
					That fate had finally found me<br>
					And your voice was all I heard<br>
					That I get what I deserve<br><br>
					So give me reason<br>
					To prove me wrong<br>
					To wash this memory clean<br>
					Let the floods cross<br>
					The distance in your eyes<br>
					Give me reason<br>
					To fill this hole<br>
					Connect this space between<br>
					Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies<br>
					Across this new divide<br><br>
					There was nothing inside<br>
					The memories left abandoned<br>
					There was nowhere to hide<br>
					The ashes fell like snow<br>
					And the ground caved in<br>
					Between where we were standing<br>
					And your voice was all I heard<br>
					That I get what I deserve<br><br>
					So give me reason<br>
					To prove me wrong<br>
					To wash this memory clean<br>
					Let the floods cross<br>
					The distance in your eyes<br>
					Across this new divide<br><br>
					In every loss in every lie<br>
					In every truth that you deny<br>
					And each regret and each goodbye<br>
					Was a mistake too great to hide<br>
					And your voice was all I heard<br>
					That I get what I deserve<br><br>
					So give me reason<br>
					To prove me wrong<br>
					To wash this memory clean<br>
					Let the floods cross<br>
					The distance in your eyes<br>
					Give me reason<br>
					To fill this hole<br>
					Connect this space between<br>
					Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies<br>
					Across this new divide<br>
					Across this new divide<br>
					Across this new divide</p>
