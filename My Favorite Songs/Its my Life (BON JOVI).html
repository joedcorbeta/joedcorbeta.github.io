			     <p>This ain't a song for the broken-hearted<br>
					No silent prayer for the faith-departed<br>
					I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd<br>
					You're gonna hear my voice<br>
					When I shout it out loud<br><br>
					It's my life<br>
					It's now or never<br>
					I ain't gonna live forever<br>
					I just want to live while I'm alive<br>
					(It's my life)<br>
					My heart is like an open highway<br>
					Like Frankie said<br>
					I did it my way<br>
					I just want to live while I'm alive<br>
					It's my life<br><br>
					This is for the ones who stood their ground<br>
					It's for Tommy and Gina who never backed down<br>
					Tomorrow's getting harder, make no mistake<br>
					Luck ain't enough<br>
					You've got to make your own breaks<br><br>
					It's my life<br>
					And it's now or never<br>
					I ain't gonna live forever<br>
					I just want to live while I'm alive<br>
					(It's my life)<br>
					My heart is like an open highway<br>
					Like Frankie said<br>
					I did it my way<br>
					I just want to live while I'm alive<br>
					It's my life<br><br>
					You better stand tall when they're calling you out<br>
					Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down<br><br>
					It's my life<br>
					And it's now or never<br>
					I ain't gonna live forever<br>
					I just want to live while I'm alive<br>
					(It's my life)<br>
					My heart is like an open highway<br>
					Like Frankie said<br>
					I did it my way<br>
					I just want to live while I'm alive<br>
					(It's my life)</p>
