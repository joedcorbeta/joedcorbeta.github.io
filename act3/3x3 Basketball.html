		  <p>THE Philippines crashed out of the Fiba 3x3 World Cup after a brave stand against 
		  second-seed Slovenia fell short, 14-21, on Wednesday (Manila time) in Nantes, France.<br> 
		  Behind the 11th-ranked Anze Srebovt, the Slovenians scored the game's first five points 
		  then jumped to a 14-4 lead, capitalizing on the Philippines' shooting woes and sloppy play.</br> 
		  The Chooks to Go-backed squad managed to trim the lead to four, 15-11, behind the heady play 
		  of Kiefer Ravena on both ends to make a game of what had earlier looked like a certain blowout.</p>
