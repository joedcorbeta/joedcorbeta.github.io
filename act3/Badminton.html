		 and Terry comfortably beat the Filipino pair 21-17, 21-12. This time round, the Singaporeans
		 could not repeat their winning performance against a pair ranked eight places below them.Hendra
		 and Terry started the match strongly, racing to a 11-5 lead in the first set.<br>The Filipinos soon
		 gained a grip on the proceedings and<br> stepped up their attacks. On the other hand, Hendra and Terry
		 could not control their own shots, eventually giving the Filipinos the first set 21-18. Once again,
		 the Singaporeans started the second set strongly to lead 11-8 at the break. But as the game wore 
		 on, the Filipinos, backed by a vocal Filipino section in the audience, gained confidence to win 
		 the set 21-15, booting Hendra and Terry out of the tournament.</p>
