			  <h1><li><b>Keyboard</b></li></h1>
			</ul>
		<p>A computer keyboard is one of the primary input devices used with a computer.<br>
		   Similar to an electric typewriter, a keyboard is composed of buttons that create letters, numbers, and symbols, as well as perform other</br> functions.
		   The following sections provide more in-depth information and answers to some of the more frequently asked questions about the keyboard.</p>
        <img src = "Images/Mouse.jpg" width = "30%"/>
		    <ul>
			  <h1><li><b>Mouse</b></li></h1>
		    </ul>
		<p>A computer mouse is a handheld hardware input device that controls a cursor in a GUI and can move and select text,<br>
		   icons, files, and folders. For desktop computers, the mouse is placed on a flat surface such as a mouse pad or a desk
		   and is</br> placed in front of your computer. The picture to the right is an example of a desktop computer mouse with two buttons and a wheel.</p>

		    <ul>
			  <h1><li><b>Monitor</b></li></h1>
		    </ul>
		<p>Alternatively referred to as a VDT (video display terminal) and VDU (video display unit),<br> a monitor is an output
		   device that displays video images and text. A monitor is made up of circuitry,</br> a screen, a power supply, buttons to 
		   adjust screen settings, and casing that holds all of these components.</p>
        <img src = "Images/Speakers.jpg" width = "40%"/>
		    <ul>
			  <h1><li><b>Speakers</b></li></h1>
		    </ul>
		<p>A computer speaker is a hardware device that<br> connects to a computer to generate sound.
		   The signal used to produce the</br> sound that comes from a computer speaker is created by the computer's sound card.</p>
		<img src = "Images/Central Processing Unit.jpg" width = "40%"/>
		    <ul>
			  <h1><li><b>Central Processing Unit</b></li></h1>
		    </ul>
		<p>Alternately referred to as a processor, central processor, or microprocessor,<br> the CPU (pronounced sea-pea-you) is the central processing
		   unit of the computer. A computer's</br> CPU handles all instructions it receives from hardware and software running on the computer.</p>
		<img src = "Images/Printer.jpg" width = "40%"/>
		    <ul>
			  <h1><li><b>Printer</b></li></h1>
		    </ul>
		<p>A printer is an external hardware output device that takes the electronic data stored on a computer or other device<br> and generates a hard copy of it.
		   For example, if you created a report on your computer you could print several copies to hand</br> out at a staff meeting. Printers are one of the most popular
		   computer peripherals and are commonly used to print text and photos. </p>
		<img src = "Images/Floppy Disk Drive.jpg" width = "40%"/>
		    <ul>
			  <h1><li><b>Floppy Disk Drive</b></li></h1>
		    </ul>
		<p>A floppy disk drive, also called FDD or FD for short, is a computer disk drive that enables a user to<br> save data to removable diskettes.
		   Although 8" disk drives were first made available in 1971, the first </br>real disk drives used were the 5 1/4" floppy disk drives, which were later 
		   replaced with the 3 1/2" floppy disk drives.</p>
		<img src = "Images/Microphone.jpg" width = "40%"/>
		    <ul>
			  <h1><li><b>Microphone</b></li></h1>
		    </ul>
		<p>Sometimes abbreviated as mic, a microphone is a hardware peripheral and input device originally<br> invented by Emile Berliner in 1877.
		   A microphone allows computer users to input audio into their computers.</br> The picture is an example of Blue Microphone's Yeti USB microphone
		   - Silver Edition and an example of a high-quality computer microphone.</p>
		<img src = "Images/DvD Drive.jpg" width = "40%"/>
		    <ul>
			  <h1><li><b>DvD Drive</b></li></h1>
		    </ul>
		<p>Short for digital versatile disc or digital video disc, a DVD or DVD-ROM is a disc capable of<br>storing large amounts of data on one disc the
  		   size of a standard Compact Disc. CD/DVD drives</br> were first sold in 1997. They are widely used for storing and viewing movies and other data.</p>
		<img src = "Images/Power Supply.jpg" width = "40%"/>
		    <ul>
			  <h1><li><b>Power Supply</b></li></h1>
		    </ul>
		<p>PS, P/S, or PSU are abbreviations for power supply or power supply unit. A power supply is a hardware component of a computer that supplies<br>
		   all components in a computer with power. The power supply converts a 110-115 or 220-230 volt AC (alternating current) into a steady low-voltage DC</br>
	       (direct current) usable by the computer and rated by the number of watts it generates. For example, the image to the right is an Antec True 
	   	   330, a 330 Watt power supply.</p>
